# Recipedia
# Description 
Recipedia is a recipe search application which allows users to input an ingredient or dish name to return results. The results return recipe cards which include links to the full recipe. Users are also given the option of finding a local resturant by clicking on the 'find a resturant' button which then displays a list of resturants and their addresses. This application is a group project which has been created by students of the Trilogy front end web development bootcamp. This project has been developed using bootstrap, jQuery and two third party APIs as required by the project guidlines.
